This episode will review how to import spatial points stored in `.csv` (Comma Separated Value) format into Python as a `geopandas` `GeoDataFrame`. We will also reproject data imported from a shapefile format, export this data as a shapefile, and plot raster and vector data as layers in the same plot.

## Spatial Data in Text Format

The `HARV_PlotLocations.csv` file contains `x, y` (point) locations for study
plot where NEON collects data on
[vegetation and other ecological metrics](https://www.neonscience.org/data-collection/terrestrial-organismal-sampling).
We would like to:

* Create a map of these plot locations.
* Export the data in a `shapefile` format to share with our colleagues. This
shapefile can be imported into any GIS software.
* Create a map showing vegetation height with plot locations layered on top.

Spatial data are sometimes stored in a text file format (`.txt` or `.csv`). If
the text file has an associated `x` and `y` location column, then we can
convert it into `geopandas GeoDataFrame` with point geometry. The `GeoDataFrame` allows us to store both the `x,y` values that represent the coordinate location
of each point and the associated attribute data - or columns describing each
feature in the spatial object.

We will continue using the `pandas`, `geopandas` and `rasterio` packages in this episode.

## Import .csv
To begin let's import a `.csv` file that contains plot coordinate `x, y`
locations at the NEON Harvard Forest Field Site (`HARV_PlotLocations.csv`) and look at the structure of
that new object:

```{python read-csv}
plot_locations_HARV = pd.read_csv("~/data/2009586/NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/HARV/HARV_PlotLocations.csv")

plot_locations_HARV.info()
```
We now have a data frame that contains 21 locations (rows) and 16 variables (attributes). Next, let's explore the `DataFrame` to determine whether it contains columns with coordinate values. If we are lucky, our `.csv` will contain columns labeled:

 * "X" and "Y" OR
 * Latitude and Longitude OR
 * easting and northing (UTM coordinates)

Let's check out the column names of our `DataFrame`.

```{python find-coordinates}
plot_locations_HARV.columns
```
## Identify X,Y Location Columns

Our column names include several fields that might contain spatial information. The `plot_locations_HARV["easting"]`
and `plot_locations_HARV["northing"]` columns contain coordinate values. We can confirm
this by looking at the first five rows of our data.


```{python check-out-coordinates}
plot_locations_HARV["easting"].head()

plot_locations_HARV["northing"].head()
```
We have coordinate values in our data frame. In order to convert our
`DataFrame` to a `GeoDataFrame`, we also need to know the CRS
associated with those coordinate values.

There are several ways to figure out the CRS of spatial data in text format.

1. We can check the file metadata in hopes that the CRS was recorded in the
data.
2. We can explore the file itself to see if CRS information is embedded in the
file header or somewhere in the data columns.

Following the `easting` and `northing` columns, there is a `geodeticDa` and a
`utmZone` column. These appear to contain CRS information
(`datum` and `projection`). Let's view those next.

```{python view-CRS-info}
plot_locations_HARV["geodeticDa"].head()
plot_locations_HARV["utmZone"].head()
```
It is not typical to store CRS information in a column. But this particular
file contains CRS information this way. The `geodeticDa` and `utmZone` columns
contain the information that helps us determine the CRS:

* `geodeticDa`: WGS84  -- this is geodetic datum WGS84
* `utmZone`: 18

In
[When Vector Data Don't Line Up - Handling Spatial Projection & CRS in Python]({{site.baseurl}}/09-vector-when-data-dont-line-up-crs/)
we learned about the components of a `proj4` string. We have everything we need
to assign a CRS to our data frame.

To create the `proj4` associated with UTM Zone 18 WGS84 we can look up the
projection on the [Spatial Reference website](http://www.spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/wgs-84-utm-zone-18n/), which contains a list of CRS formats for each projection. From here, we can extract the [proj4 string for UTM Zone 18N WGS84](http://www.spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/wgs-84-utm-zone-18n/proj4/).

However, if we have other data in the UTM Zone 18N projection, it's much
easier to use the `.crs` method to extract the CRS in `proj4` format from that GeoDataFrame and
assign it to our
new GeoDataFrame. We've seen this CRS before with our Harvard Forest study site (`point_HARV`).

```{python explore-units}
point_HARV.crs
```
The output above shows that the points shapefile is in
UTM zone 18N. We can thus use the CRS from that spatial object to convert our
non-spatial `DataFrame` into an `GeoDataFrame` with point geometry.

Next, let's create a `crs` object that we can use to define the CRS of our
`GeoDataFrame` when we create it.
```{python crs-object}
utm18nCRS = point_HARV.crs
utm18nCRS
```
## .csv to GeoDataFrame
Next, let's convert our `DataFrame` into a `GeoDataFrame` To do
this, we need to specify:

1. The columns containing X (`easting`) and Y (`northing`) coordinate values
2. The CRS that the column coordinate represent (units are included in the CRS) - stored in our `utmCRS` object.

We will use the `points_from_xy()` function to perform the conversion.

```{python convert-csv-shapefile}
plot_locations_HARV_gdf = gpd.GeoDataFrame(plot_locations_HARV, geometry=gpd.points_from_xy(plot_locations_HARV.easting, plot_locations_HARV.northing), crs=utm18nCRS)
```
We should double check the CRS to make sure it is correct.

```{python}
plot_locations_HARV_gdf.crs
```
## Plot Spatial Object
We now have a `GeoDataFrame`, we can plot our newly created spatial object.
```{python plot-data-points}
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
plot_locations_HARV_gdf.plot(ax=ax)
plt.title("Map of Plot Locations")
plt.show()
```
## Plot Extent

In
[Open and Plot Shapefiles in Python]({{site.baseurl}}/06-vector-open-shapefile-in-python/)
we learned about `GeoDataFrame` extent. When we plot several spatial layers in
Python using `matplotlib`, all of the layers of the plot are considered in setting the boundaries
of the plot. To show this, let's plot our `aoi_boundary_HARV` object with our vegetation plots.

```{python plot-data}
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
plot_locations_HARV_gdf.plot(ax=ax)
aoi_boundary_HARV.plot(ax=ax, facecolor="None", edgecolor="orange")
plt.title("AOI Boundary Plot")
plt.show()
```

When we plot the two layers together, `ggplot` sets the plot boundaries
so that they are large enough to include all of the data included in all of the layers.
That's really handy!
